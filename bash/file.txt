Because private addresses have no global meaning, routing informationabout private networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterpriselinks, and packets with private source or destination addressesshould not be forwarded across such links. We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as"20-bit block", and to the third as "16-bit" block. Indirect references to such addresses should be contained within theenterprise. An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the addressspace defined in this document can do so without any coordinationwith IANA or an Internet registry.  Public hosts can communicatewith other hosts inside the enterprise both public and private andcan have IP connectivity to public hosts outside the enterprise.  The address space can thus be usedby many enterprises.  Prominent examples of such references are DNS ResourceRecords and other information referring to internal privateaddresses. All other hosts will be public and will use globally unique addressspace assigned by an Internet Registry.  In particular, Internet service providers should takemeasures to prevent such leakage.
